# About MISHA
{: style="text-align:center"}
MISHA (Multi-spectral Imaging System for the Humanities and Archives) is a program funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. Its goal is to provide a cost-effective way for cultural heritage institutions to research and document artifacts in their collections. The system consists of two LED panels, a camera, and two software applications. <br/><br/>
One of those applications captures multi-spectral images by controlling the camera and LED panels and the other processes those images for further analysis. The hardware has already been completed and a prototype of the software has been made. So far, this system has been used to make discoveries on a variety of artifacts ranging from medieval manuscripts to baseballs. <br/><br/>
The goal of this project is to redevelop the software applications in order to create a system that is more user-friendly, accessible, efficient, reliable, and well-documented. In addition to capturing images, the system will also allow for the collection of metadata to help institutions better organize and analyze the results from the imaging system. As an open-source project, the software will be designed to be extendable so improvements can continue to be made beyond the scope of this project.
